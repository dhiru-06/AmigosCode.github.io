                           <p>Hi! My name is Dheeraj and I am a life-o-holic. I have intended to write this article purely about my coding journey, 
                               as the title may suggest. But then I changed my mind. While I identify professionally as a programmer, programming 
                               has given me much more than a job and a title. Programming has given me something much more than money, 
                               the respect of my peers and free drinks vouchers at the company party. Programming has given me something far
                               more valuable.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            This — ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, aliens and superheroes — is the real story of
                             reclaiming one’s life and it all starts with a dude, just off the boat — alone in Belfast 
                             with a suitcase and just enough money in his pocket to rent a room — yet full of hope and 
                             an almost naive conviction that few things are truly impossible.

                            This July I am 23, and 5 years ago things looked a whole lot different. I have no college degree. I dont know how to 
                            start which is very important for any one ,then finally took an admmission in a institute where I  studied for 4 years
                          </p>

                          <p>
                            The only post-high-school education I received was a Java Developer certification which I did in
                             my home-town, Arad, for the most part of 2017 and 2018. It was the first time I actually 
                             studied something I was interested in. I generally didn’t care much about school before. 
                             I was a good enough student, never failed at anything, but it always felt like a chore. And
                              this is the first detour in my story …
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Code was beginning to interest me because it seemed like there are always barriers between me and my ideas.
                             Whether it be budget, time, or others. It was time to learn some things myself. 
                          </p>
                          <P>
                              After completing my Java certification i started learning Advance Java , where I started working on projects
                              and gained practical knowledge which is very important, I still remember the institute where I learn to code
                              there me and my friends form a team and started working on a project, which solve the problems of blood donation
                              and for that work the institute awarded us with a cash prize
                          </P>
                          <p>
                              After becaming strong in java , I started learning Android which was simple for me , just because i was 
                              strong with my basics I didn’t faced any problems learning Android. And thats the case if you want to start 
                              with coding just start learning with any language first ,after that every thing will be easy for you                          </p>
                    
                              
                              
                          <p>
                           <p>
                            And now, presently I started learning JavaScript and its libraries react.js which is very exciting,
                            and fully concentrating on it :)!!!

                            <br>
                            <br>
                           </p>
                        <p>
                            By no means am I anywhere close to the end of my code learning journey. In fact,
                             I believe there's no end to this journey. Thankfully, throughout my code learning journey, 
                            I've met some really awesome people and discovered very helpful tools and communities.
                            I hope my journey will inspire you and that you will find your own unique ways to learn how to code as well!

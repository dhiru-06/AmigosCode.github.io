                            Java is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It is used to develop desktop and mobile applications,
                             big data processing, embedded systems, and so on. According to Oracle, the company that owns Java,
                             Java runs on 3 billion devices worldwide, which makes Java one of the most popular programming languages.
                        </p>
                        <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language: OOP makes the complete program simpler by dividing it into a 
                            number of objects. The objects can be used as a bridge to have data flow from one function to another.
                             We can easily modify data and function’s as per the requirements of the program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Java is a multithreaded language: Java can perform many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. 
                            For example, a program that manages a Graphical User Interface (GUI) while waiting for input from a network connection uses another thread to perform and wait’s instead of
                             using the default GUI thread for both tasks. This keeps the GUI responsive.

                            Although there are other ways to make Android apps, most of the applications are written in Java using Google’s Android API. 
                            Although Android uses difference JVM and packaging methods, the code is still predominantly Java.

                        Python is tying with Java as the second most popular programming language behind JavaScript, 
                        according to developer analyst RedMonk's latest ranking. 
                        The second spot for Python is the highest position it's ever attained in RedMonk's list of top programming languages, 
                        which is based on an analysis of GitHub and Stack Overflow data.   
                        Historically, Python has been steady in fourth position but it rose to third spot three years ago in RedMonk's tables.

                    C/C++ is like the bread and butter of programming. Almost all low-level systems such as operating systems, file systems, etc are written in C/C++. If you wish to be a system-level programmer, C/C++ is the language you should learn. C++ is also widely used by 
                    competitive programmers owing to the fact that it is extremely fast and stable. C++ also provides something called STL - Standard Template Library. STL is a pool of ready-to-use libraries for various data structures, arithmetic operations, and algorith
                    The library support and speed of the language make it a popular choice in the High-frequency trading community as well.

                    C++ is often being used in IoT. It does a really good job with advanced programming. With the technological
                     progress, there was created an Internet of Things (IoT) concept. Basically it means creating connection, 
                     exchange, processing and storing informations between devices without human interaction. It’s a very general 
                     term that describes all of the embedded devices that originally didn’t have an Internet connection. C++
                      is very commonly used in IoT since its very powerful capabilities. In the last few years IoT market has 
                      registered an enormous growth. More and more companies 
                    invest in newest technology to improve their businesses. C++ can give you an access to many interesting IoT projects.

                JavaScript is the “frontend” programming language. JavaScript is widely used to design interactive frontend applications. For instance, when you click on a button which opens up a popup, the logic is implemented via JavaScript.
                These days, many organizations, particularly startups, are using NodeJS which is a JavaScript-based run-time environment. 
                node.js lets developers use JavaScript for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Hence now with JS, you can use a single programming language for server-side and client-side scripts. 
                If you are looking for that cool tech job at your favorite startup, you should seriously consider learning JavaScript.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript was the first widely supported language which was implemented across all browsers.
                 If you wanted to show a popup, only JavaScript could do that. 
                That led to a natural path of world dominance, which we still see as of today.
              </p>
              <p>
                Node.Js, or Node, is one of the most popular versions of server-side JavaScript. Node has been used to write large platforms 
                for NASA, eBay and many others. Since Javascript can execute programs out of order, Node can use it to create scalable web applications, messaging platforms, 
                and multiplayer games. This is why Google Cloud and Amazon Web Service depend on Node for some of their services.

                React is also one of the most popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of 
                individual 
                developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications

            The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed 
            specifically for web development. PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in
             a PHP file. The thing that differentiates PHP with client-side
             language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            With PHP, coding is like writing an essay in English for a computer to read, except the essay is a piece of code that
             instructs it to create and run websites in the most efficient manner possible. Creating a code in PHP is simple, 
             and though you’ll hear some developers complaining that this does not build the necessary coding habits
             that streamlines (read standardizes) coding, it allows the code to be highly personalized (and hence easier to protect).
          </p>
          <p>
            PHP makes websites amoebic, allowing the developers to transform them at their will. All PHP websites are fully
             customizable and can be transformed to meet the requirements of the customers with ease because Content Management
              Systems like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and others are primarily 
            based on PHP. Hence, developing or integrating a robust custom-made CMS solution with your website is simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            A code created in PHP can run on all the major platforms, allowing the developer to seamlessly integrate website
             across multiple platforms. This allows the business to cost-effectively leverage all existing infrastructure, 
             leveraging platforms 
            as diverse as Windows, Unix, and Linux, with the additional ability to interface their website with MySQL and Apace

            Scala is a general-purpose programming language providing support for functional programming and a strong 
            static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Scala is a general-purpose, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. It is a pure object-oriented programming
             language which also provides support to the functional programming approach. Scala programs can convert to bytecodes
              and can run on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Scala stands for Scalable language. It also provides Javascript
               runtimes. 
            Scala is highly influenced by Java and some other programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, Pizza etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            As per Stack Overflow annual developer survey 2019, 
            Scala is the highest-paid programming language in the US, and the 4th most highly paid programming language globally.

            Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is
             syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency
          </p>
          <p>
            Go is designed specifically as a systems programming language for large, distributed 
            systems and highly-scalable network servers. In that vein, it replaces C++ and Java in Google's software stack.
            Go is definitely worth learning if you have an interest in languages that make parallelism and concurrency part
             of the language. It takes some elements from dynamic 
            languages like Python and couples them with static typing at compile time, which is what initially attracted me.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's easy to use but also does a lot of the useful things a statically-typed language does, such as picking up 
            errors at compile time. ... GoLang is also great at concurrency and as it was designed 
            for server software and can solve “Google-sized problems”, it is a language that is suited to cloud computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Go Is Fast
            Because Go is compiled to machine code, it will naturally outperform languages that are interpreted or have virtual runtimes. Go programs also compile extremely fast,
             and the resulting binary is very small. Our API compiles in seconds and produces an executable file that is very reliable

            Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is
             used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented,
             class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dart is an object-oriented programming language by Google, 
            which aims to help the developer build modern web applications. It covers client, server and now mobile with Flutter.
            Before you dive into Flutter you have to learn the programming language that is used to build Flutter apps, and that
             is Dart. While learning Dart is not that difficult of a task, 
            because it is more or less a mixture of Java and JavaScript, it still takes time to understand a programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dart. One of GitHub's most popular open-source projects (by contributor count) is Flutter, a cross-platform 
            framework for building apps, originally built
             by Google. ... If you're doing anything cross-platform in 2020, Dart is worth your time to examine thoroughly.
